# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using AutoEncoder (PyOD)

This project applies a deep learning-based anomaly detection approach using an **AutoEncoder** from the [PyOD](https://pyod.readthedocs.io/) library to identify fraudulent transactions in an anonymized credit card dataset.

AutoEncoders learn the pattern of normal transactions and identify frauds as outliers based on **reconstruction error**.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset** from Kaggle.

- Download the dataset from:
  👉 [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

- Extract the `creditcard.csv` file into the root project folder.

Alternatively, for testing:
- Download the pre-packaged zipped test file here:
  👉 `fraud_detection.zip` *(hosted in this repo or your Google Drive/GitHub if applicable)*
